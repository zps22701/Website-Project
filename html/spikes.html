		<h2>What Events do you run?</h2>
		<p>Depending on what events you participate in, your specific shoes are very 
		important and may give you that fractional edge you need to come out on top.</p>

		<h2>Cadence</h2>
		<p>The amount of times your feet hit the ground while running per minute is your cadence. Different types of shoes are specially designed for different cadences which occur at different speeds.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sprinters- this varies based on body type but most olympic sprinters have a cadence in the range of 220-240 (this means they cover almost 3m per step!)<br>

			</li>
			<li>Middle Distance- these runners have a much slower cadence of about 200 steps/min</li>
			<li>Distance- it is agreed that any runner from 1600m to marathons should have a cadence of 180, this is the best amount of steps to take for your body to be as efficient as possible.<br>
